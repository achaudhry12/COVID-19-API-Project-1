### **Wireframe:**

### **MVP:**

- Need a drop down menu that can acess every model, color, manufacturer, trim, etc
- Need a input area to help supplement a secondary input of a VIN number
- From the vechile vin # the application should be able to figure out what the vehicle's matching image is and as well as other statistics about it.
- Be able to pull up multiple results from a select choice of specs
- Use responsive design by implementing media queries
- Use flexbox to help organzie webpage

### **Post-MVP:**

- Add another API!
- Make more media queries
- Add cool animations
- Add filters?

### **Goals:**

- The goal at the end of April 19th is to have all the JS and HTML done and finalized (if there is time add another API!)

- The goal at the end of April 20th is to have all the CSS styling put on there and make the website look nice

- The goal at the end of April 21st is to help refine the site more, add media queries to enable more flexiblity across displays, go through entire code, debug if necessary

### **Priority Matrix:**
