### Wireframes



### MVP

- Need a drop down menu that can acess every model, color, manufacturer, trim, etc
- Need a input area to help supplemnt a secondary input of a VIN number
- From these data points the website should be able to figure out what the vehicle's matching image is and as well as other statistics about it.
- Use responsive design by implementing media queries

### Post-MVP

- Add another API!

### Goals

The goal at the end of April 19th is to have all the JS and HTML done and finalized (if there is time add another API!)

The goal at the end of April 20th is to have all the CSS styling put on there and make the website look nice

The goal at the end of April 21st is to help refine the site more, add media queries to enable more flexiblity across displays, go through entire code, debug if necessary
